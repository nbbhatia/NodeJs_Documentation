1. I am using handleBar for template engine due to this we create views folder which is compulsory

ques:- Why we use template Engine?
Ans:- with the use of template engine we can easily work with dynamic data.

eg.

If any user login in our website then  login text -> with {login USERNAME}.this process is easily 
done by Template engine ,Pug, mustache and EJS

ques:- can we change views  name ??
ans :- yes we can 
app.set("views", "customName")
