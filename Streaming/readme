1. Streams are object that let you  read data from a source  or write data to a destination in continous  fashion. 
In Node.js,there are 4 type of streams:-

2.******** Easy language*******
Streaming means  listening to music or watching video in "realTime",instead of downloading a file to ur computer and watching it later.

3. pehle yeh hota tha ki jb bhi hme koi music ya vedio dekhni hoti thi to hme usko download krke hi dekhna pdta tha live hm
 nahi dekh skte the lekin ab streaming ki help se ab hm vedio or song real time m sun skte hai.

4.********** Example***********
a)Jaise cricket match m ata h streaming partner means ki streaming partner  ek service provide krta hai jiski help se sab log apne apne ghr m baith kr live match dekh skte hai.
b) ab Jaise hm koi vedio dekh rhe hai or vo vedio 10 min ki hai to 2 min,3min 4min aise aise chote chote chunks m vedio load ho rhi hai  bs isi  kaam ko streaming kaha jata hai.

there are 4 types of Streams in nodejs:-

Readable-  jha kuch read krna ho.
Writable - Jha par hme kuch write krna ho.
Duplex - aisi stream jha read or write dono ho jaye.
Transform -  A type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on input.

yeah sare stream belong to EVENTEMMITER instance.
 
 ***********ab Streaming krne ke liuye most common used events jo hai -************
1- data Event= this event is fired when there is data is available for read.
2- end Event= this event is fired when  there is no more data to read.
3- error Event = this event is fired when there is any error receiveing or writing data.
4- finish = this event is fired when all the data has been flushed to underlying system.
